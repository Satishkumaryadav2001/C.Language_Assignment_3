# C.Language_Assignment_3

Ques 1 What are the primitive data types in C Language? 

Ans: In **C language**, there are **6 primitive data types**:

1. **`int`** ‚Äì Represents integer numbers (whole numbers).
   - Example: `int x = 5;`

2. **`char`** ‚Äì Represents a single character.
   - Example: `char letter = 'A';`
   - It typically occupies 1 byte of memory.

3. **`float`** ‚Äì Represents single-precision floating-point numbers (decimals).
   - Example: `float pi = 3.14f;`
   - Usually occupies 4 bytes.

4. **`double`** ‚Äì Represents double-precision floating-point numbers (more precise decimals).
   - Example: `double gravity = 9.81;`
   - Usually occupies 8 bytes.

5. **`void`** ‚Äì Represents the absence of data (used for functions that do not return a value).
   - Example: `void functionName() {}`

6. **`short`** ‚Äì Represents short integers (usually 2 bytes).
   - Example: `short num = 100;`

---

### üß† Key Points:
- **`int`**, **`char`**, **`float`**, and **`double`** are the most commonly used types for basic data storage.
- **`void`** is used when a function does not return any value.

---

These are the **primitive** data types in **C**, and they form the foundation for building more complex data types (arrays, structs, etc.).

Ques 2  What kind of statements can be written outside the function body ?

Ans In **C**, the only type of statement that can be written **outside** the function body is **declarations** (such as variable declarations and function prototypes).

---

### üîç Here's the breakdown:

1. **Function Prototypes**:
   - A **function prototype** declares the function's signature, which tells the compiler about the function's name, return type, and parameters before its actual definition.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int add(int, int);  // function prototype (declaration)
     ```

2. **Variable Declarations** (in global scope):
   - **Global variables** are declared outside the function body but **must** be initialized later in the function body or elsewhere.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int x;  // Global variable declaration outside any function
     ```

3. **Preprocessor Directives** (like `#define`, `#include`):
   - These are used outside the function body, typically at the beginning of the code.
   - Example:
     ```c
     #include <stdio.h>  // Preprocessor directive
     ```

---

### ‚ùå What can't be written outside the function body?
- **Executable statements** like loops (`for`, `while`), conditionals (`if`, `switch`), or function calls cannot be written outside function bodies. They must appear **inside** a function.

---

### ‚úÖ So, **outside the function body**, you can have:
- **Function prototypes**
- **Global variable declarations**
- **Preprocessor directives**

Let me know if you need further clarification! 

Ques 3 What is the size of the float type variable ? 

Ans :  In C, the size of a **`float`** type variable is typically **4 bytes** (32 bits). 

### üîç Key Details:
- **Size**: 4 bytes (or 32 bits)
- **Range**: The range of values that a `float` can represent is approximately ¬±3.4E‚àí38 to ¬±3.4E+38, with a precision of about 6 to 7 decimal digits.

### Example:
```c
float pi = 3.14159;
```

### üìè How to check the size programmatically:
You can use the `sizeof` operator to find the size of any type:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Size of float: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(float));
    return 0;
}
```

This will output:

```
Size of float: 4 bytes
```

However, note that the size can vary on some platforms (e.g., older or embedded systems might have different sizes).


Ques 4 What is the value of an uninitialized variable ?

Ans : In **C**, the value of an **uninitialized variable** is **undefined**. This means that if you declare a variable but don't assign it a value, it can contain any random or garbage value left in memory from previous programs or processes.

### üîç Details:

1. **Local variables** (variables declared inside functions):
   - **Uninitialized local variables** have **undefined values**. They could be anything, and using them without initialization can lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int x;  // Uninitialized local variable
     printf("%d", x);  // This will print a random, garbage value
     ```

2. **Global variables** (variables declared outside functions):
   - **Uninitialized global variables** are automatically initialized to **zero** by the compiler. This is a special behavior for global (and static) variables.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int x;  // Global variable, automatically initialized to 0
     printf("%d", x);  // This will print 0
     ```

3. **Static variables** (variables declared with the `static` keyword):
   - Similar to global variables, **uninitialized static variables** are automatically initialized to **zero**.
   - Example:
     ```c
     static int x;  // Static variable, automatically initialized to 0
     printf("%d", x);  // This will print 0
     ```

### üö® **Warning**:
- **Using uninitialized local variables** can cause serious bugs, as their values are unpredictable.
- Always **initialize variables** before using them to avoid relying on random values.

Ques 5  What is the difference between float and double ?

Ans : The key differences between **`float`** and **`double`** in C are related to **precision**, **range**, and **memory size**.

### üîç **Differences between `float` and `double`**:

| Feature            | **`float`**                                    | **`double`**                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Size**           | 4 bytes (32 bits)                             | 8 bytes (64 bits)                             |
| **Precision**      | ~6-7 decimal digits                           | ~15-16 decimal digits                         |
| **Range**          | Approximately ¬±3.4E‚àí38 to ¬±3.4E+38            | Approximately ¬±1.7E‚àí308 to ¬±1.7E+308          |
| **Default**        | Single-precision floating-point               | Double-precision floating-point               |
| **Memory Usage**   | Uses less memory                             | Uses more memory                             |
| **Performance**    | Faster on systems with limited resources (less precision) | Slower on systems with limited resources (higher precision) |
| **Usage**          | Typically used when memory is a concern and less precision is acceptable | Used when more precision is needed (e.g., scientific calculations) |

### üö® **Example Code**:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float f = 3.14159265359f;  // 'f' is used to indicate a float
    double d = 3.14159265359;  // Double by default
    
    printf("Float value: %f\n", f);  // Displays up to 6-7 significant digits
    printf("Double value: %lf\n", d);  // Displays up to 15-16 significant digits
    
    return 0;
}
```

### üß† **Summary**:
- **`float`** is used for **single precision** (less memory, lower precision).
- **`double`** is used for **double precision** (more memory, higher precision).

In general, **`double`** is preferred when you need more **accuracy** in calculations, especially in scientific or financial applications.


Ques 6 What is the full form of ASCII ?

Ans :   The full form of **ASCII** is **American Standard Code for Information Interchange**. 

### üîç **What is ASCII?**
- It is a character encoding standard used for representing **text** and **control characters** in computers and communication devices.
- ASCII uses **7 bits** to represent each character, allowing it to represent **128 unique characters** (including letters, digits, punctuation marks, and control characters).

### üß† **Examples**:
- **`A`** in ASCII is represented as **65**.
- **`a`** is represented as **97**.
- **Space** is represented as **32**.

Let me know if you'd like more details about ASCII!


Ques 7  What is the difference between a keyword and a function ? 


Ans :  The difference between a **keyword** and a **function** in C programming can be understood in terms of **their purpose**, **usage**, and **role** in the language.

### üîç **Difference between Keyword and Function**:

| **Aspect**         | **Keyword**                                         | **Function**                                        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | A **reserved word** that has a **special meaning** in the language syntax. It cannot be used as an identifier (variable name, function name, etc.). | A **block of code** designed to perform a specific task. Functions are **user-defined** or **library-defined**. |
| **Purpose**        | Keywords are part of the **syntax** and structure of the language. They define how the program is structured and how control flows. | Functions allow you to **modularize** your code. They enable **code reuse** and organize logic into smaller, manageable pieces. |
| **Example**        | `int`, `if`, `return`, `while`, `for`, `static` (These are **C keywords**) | `printf()`, `scanf()`, `main()`, `add()` (These are **functions** in C) |
| **Usage**          | Keywords are used to control the flow, define data types, or perform specific tasks that are predefined by the language. | Functions are used to **define behavior** and **process logic**. Functions can either be built-in (like `printf()`) or user-defined (like `add()` in your own program). |
| **Modifiable?**    | No, keywords **cannot** be changed, redefined, or used as identifiers. They have fixed roles in the language. | Yes, functions can be **created**, **modified**, and **called** by programmers. |

---

### üß† **Key Takeaways**:

- **Keywords**: Predefined by the language. They cannot be redefined and control the program‚Äôs structure.
- **Functions**: Can be created, modified, and used by the programmer to perform specific tasks or calculations.

Ques 8 Explore the use of type modifiers in C language. 

Ans : In **C programming**, **type modifiers** are used to **alter** or **extend** the size and range of basic data types like `int`, `char`, `float`, and `double`. They allow you to specify **whether the variable should be signed or unsigned**, or whether the variable should be **shortened** or **extended** in size.

### üîç **List of Type Modifiers in C**:

1. **`signed`**:
   - The `signed` modifier is used to specify that a variable can hold both **positive** and **negative** values.
   - By default, integer types (`int`, `char`, etc.) are **signed**, meaning they can store both negative and positive values.
   - **Example**: `signed int a;`
   
2. **`unsigned`**:
   - The `unsigned` modifier is used to specify that a variable can only hold **positive** values (including zero).
   - This effectively doubles the **positive range** of the variable, since it doesn‚Äôt need to store negative numbers.
   - **Example**: `unsigned int b;`
   
3. **`short`**:
   - The `short` modifier is used to reduce the size of the data type. It creates a **shorter** version of the type.
   - It is typically used with integer types (`int`) to store smaller values, usually using 2 bytes.
   - **Example**: `short int c;` (typically 2 bytes)

4. **`long`**:
   - The `long` modifier is used to **increase** the size of the data type. It allows the variable to hold **larger values**.
   - It is typically used with integer types (`int`) to store larger values, usually using 4 bytes or more.
   - **Example**: `long int d;` (typically 4 bytes)

5. **`long long`**:
   - The `long long` modifier is used to extend the size of the integer type even more, usually used for storing very large integers.
   - **Example**: `long long int e;` (typically 8 bytes)

6. **`long double`**:
   - The `long double` modifier is used with floating-point types to increase precision. It allows the variable to store **larger and more precise decimal values** than `float` and `double`.
   - **Example**: `long double f;` 

### üß† **Combined Modifiers**:
- You can combine these modifiers to customize the size and range of the variable.
  - **Example 1**: `unsigned long int g;` (A long integer that can only store positive values)
  - **Example 2**: `signed short int h;` (A short integer that can store both positive and negative values)
  - **Example 3**: `unsigned long long int i;` (An extended integer for larger positive values)

### üí° **Size of Data Types**:
| Data Type      | Size (Typically) | Range (Approx.)              |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| `char`         | 1 byte           | -128 to 127 (signed)         |
| `unsigned char`| 1 byte           | 0 to 255                     |
| `short`        | 2 bytes          | -32,768 to 32,767            |
| `unsigned short`| 2 bytes         | 0 to 65,535                  |
| `int`          | 4 bytes          | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| `unsigned int` | 4 bytes          | 0 to 4,294,967,295           |
| `long`         | 4 bytes          | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| `long long`    | 8 bytes          | -9.22E18 to 9.22E18          |
| `float`        | 4 bytes          | ¬±3.4E‚àí38 to ¬±3.4E+38         |
| `double`       | 8 bytes          | ¬±1.7E‚àí308 to ¬±1.7E+308       |
| `long double`  | 8 bytes or more | ¬±1.7E‚àí308 to ¬±1.7E+308 (more precision than double) |

### üö® **Important Notes**:
- **Size**: The exact size of data types can vary depending on the system architecture (e.g., 32-bit vs 64-bit systems).
- **Default behavior**: `int` is signed by default, so if you don't specify the modifier, it will treat it as signed.
- **Range Extension**: Using `unsigned` allows for a larger **positive range**, but no negative values. On the other hand, `signed` can store both positive and negative values but with a smaller range for positive numbers.

### üß† **Example Code**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    short int a = -32000;    // short int (2 bytes, signed by default)
    unsigned int b = 300000; // unsigned int (4 bytes, no negative values)
    long long int c = 9223372036854775807; // long long int (8 bytes)

    printf("short int a: %d\n", a);
    printf("unsigned int b: %u\n", b);
    printf("long long int c: %lld\n", c);

    return 0;
}
```

### ‚úÖ **Summary**:
- **Type modifiers** allow you to **adjust** the **size** and **range** of the variables.
- **Common modifiers** include `signed`, `unsigned`, `short`, `long`, and `long long`.
- These modifiers help manage **memory usage** and **data range** depending on your needs.

Ques 9  Can you assign a character constant in an int variable ?

Ans: Yes, you **can** assign a **character constant** to an **`int`** variable in C.

In C, a **character constant** (e.g., `'A'`, `'b'`) is actually represented by its **ASCII value**, which is an integer. So, assigning a character constant to an `int` variable will store the **ASCII value** of the character in the integer variable.

### üîç **Example**:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num;
    char ch = 'A';  // character constant

    // Assigning the character constant to an int variable
    num = ch;

    printf("The ASCII value of '%c' is: %d\n", ch, num);
    return 0;
}
```

### üß† **Explanation**:
- The character `'A'` has an **ASCII value** of **65**.
- When you assign `'A'` to an `int` variable, the integer variable stores the **ASCII value** 65, which is the integer representation of `'A'`.

### Output:
```
The ASCII value of 'A' is: 65
```

### üö® **Important Notes**:
- **Character constants** (like `'A'`, `'1'`, `'%'`) are treated as **integers** (their ASCII values) when assigned to an `int`.
- **Int to char conversion**: You can also do the reverse. If you assign an integer to a `char` variable, it will store the corresponding character for that integer value (within the valid ASCII range).

Ques 10 State the following statement as true or false -‚ÄùEvery block of code is a function‚Äù. 

Ans : The statement **"Every block of code is a function"** is **false**.

### Explanation:
- In C, a **block of code** is simply a **group of statements** enclosed in **curly braces `{}`**, and it does not necessarily have to be a **function**.
- A **function** is a specific type of block of code that has:
  - A **name**.
  - A **return type**.
  - **Parameters** (optional).
  - A **return statement** (optional, depending on the return type).
  
### Example:
- A **block of code**:
  ```c
  {
      int x = 5;
      printf("%d", x);
  }
  ```
  This is just a block of code, not a function.
  
- A **function**:
  ```c
  int add(int a, int b) {
      return a + b;
  }
  ```
  This is a **function** with a name, parameters, and a return type.

### Conclusion:
- **Not every block of code is a function**. Functions are specific blocks of code that have a defined structure and purpose in the program.
-
